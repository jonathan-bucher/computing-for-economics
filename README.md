# Machine Learning and Computing for Economics Projects

This repository contains projects completed during my graduate-level course on Machine Learning and Computing for Economics as part of my Master's program in Econometrics. The coursework integrated advanced computational techniques and machine learning applications with economic analysis, providing practical experience in data handling, model selection, and numerical optimization.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

1. **api**

   - Used the World Bank API to retrieve and analyze economic data for various countries and indicators.
   - Demonstrated skills in API integration, data wrangling, and exploratory data analysis.

2. **sql**

   - Queried a database of music streaming history to analyze user behavior and preferences.
   - Applied SQL techniques for data extraction, aggregation, and insight generation.

3. **machine_learning**

   - Employed cross-validation techniques to select the appropriate machine learning models for economic datasets.
   - Evaluated models based on performance metrics to ensure robust predictions and insights.

4. **math_opt**

   - Implemented numerical methods for optimization problems relevant to economic modeling.
   - Included applications such as finding equilibria and solving constrained optimization problems.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Integration**: API usage, SQL querying, and data cleaning.
- **Machine Learning**: Cross-validation, model evaluation, and selection.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Numerical methods for solving economic problems.
- **Programming Languages**: Python and SQL.
